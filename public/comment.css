/* CSS Comments
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with :

Example */

/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

Example */

p {
  color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
}

/* Even in the middle of a code line:

Example */

p {
  color: /*red*/blue; 
}

/* Comments can also span multiple lines:  

Example */


/* This is
a multi-line
comment */

p {
  color: red;
}

/* HTML and CSS Comments
From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the <!--...--> syntax.

In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
  color: red; /* Set text color to red
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>My Heading</h2>

<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>HTML and CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

</body>
</html>
 */

 /* CSS Errors
Errors in CSS can lead to unexpected behavior or styles not being applied correctly. This page shows common CSS mistakes and how to avoid them.

Missing Semicolons
Forgetting a semicolon at the end of a property declaration can break the style rule.

Example */

.bad {
  color: red;
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* Invalid Property Names
Using a property name that does not exist will simply be ignored by the browser.

Example */

.bad {
  colr: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
/* Unclosed Braces
If you forget to close a brace }, the entire rule may be ignored.

Example */

/* .bad {
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px; */



/* Extra Colons or Braces
Typos like extra colons or misplaced braces can cause rules to break.

Example */

/* .bad {
  color:: blue;
} */
