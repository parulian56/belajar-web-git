/* CSS Outline - Shorthand property
The outline property is a shorthand property for setting the following individual outline properties:

outline-width
outline-style (required)
outline-color
The outline property is specified as one, two, or three values from the list above. The order of the values does not matter.

The following example shows some outlines specified with the shorthand outline property: */

p.ex1 {outline: dashed;}
p.ex2 {outline: dotted red;}
p.ex3 {outline: 5px solid yellow;}
p.ex4 {outline: thick ridge pink;}

/* CSS Outline Offset
The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.

The following example specifies an outline 15px outside the border edge: */

p {
  margin: 30px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  outline: 1px solid red;
  outline-offset: 15px;
}

/* The following example shows that the space between an element and its outline is transparent:

This paragraph has an outline of 15px outside the border edge.

Example */

p {
  margin: 30px;
  background: yellow;
  border: 1px solid black;
