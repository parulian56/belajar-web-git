/* CSS Flexible Box Layout Module
Before the Flexible Box Layout module, there were four layout modes:

Block, for sections in a webpage
Inline, for text
Table, for two-dimensional table data
Positioned, for explicit position of an element
CSS flexbox is supported in all modern browsers.

CSS Flexbox Components
A flexbox always consists of:

Flex Items - the items inside the container <div>
