/* The CSS object-position property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be positioned within its container.

The Image
Look at the following image from Paris, which is 400x300 pixels:

Paris
Next, we use object-fit: cover; to keep the aspect ratio and to fill the given dimension. However, the image will be clipped to fit, like this:

Paris
Example */
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
}

/* 
Using the object-position Property
Let's say that the part of the image that is shown, is not positioned as we want. To position the image, we will use the object-position property.

Here we will use the object-position property to position the image so that the great old building is in center:

Paris
Example */
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: 80% 100%;
}
/* Here we will use the object-position property to position the image so that the famous Eiffel Tower is in center:

Paris
Example */
img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: 15% 100%;
}
